# ASPP 2025 - Reflection

I am currently on my way back from Plovdiv, Bulgaria, where I participated in this year's edition of the Advanced Scientific Programming in Python (ASPP) Summer School.
This blogpost is intended to give a brief overview about the Summer School and included reflection on my time there.
To take it away in one sentence: I had such an amazing time and would highly recommend it to anyone who's 
analyzing data / doing science.

## Pre-ASPP
I wasn't entirely sure what to expect (in terms of content, presumed background knowledge etc.), which made me feel slightly nervous going into it. At the same time, I was also really excited to spend an entire week deep-diving into best practices of scientific programming. Importantly, my energy levels and social battery were high going into it.
I thought it would be a great opportunity to chat to the other participants about their career choices and PhD / Postdoctoral experiences.

## During the Summer School
Every day consisted of interactive lectures, which covered topics like version control using git, the basics of computer architecture and scientific programming patterns.
The lectures also included live coding and programming exercises. For the programming exercises, we worked together in pairs, switching them for each new topic.
This was a completely new experience for me. It taught me a lot about how other people approach coding problems, and it made me aware of my own weaknesses.
In the past, programming has always been an individual experience for me. But this makes writing "bad" code incredibely easy and you start developing bad habits (with no one correcting you).
I think I am realising more and more that programming, at its core, is all about problem solving.
For the final school tournament, we developed a bot to compete against the bots of other teams in the game Pelita, which is similar to Pac-Man.

## Post-ASPP Reflection
You know it's been a good learning experience when the time just flies by. Even though the days were long and we covered a lot of content, it was always fun and very collaborative.
My main takeaways: I will be more mindful about my own coding hygiene and habits (e.g. moving away from jupyter notebooks).
I am also incredibley gratefult that I got to attend ASPP at this (early) point in my career.
Why?
