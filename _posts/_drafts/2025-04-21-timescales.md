How can we best understand the timescales of neural systems?
=====
Temporal structure dictactes our daily life. We experience time periods with varying amounts of incoming sensory stimulation (which can be more or less regular in its nature).
Neural processes are spatiotemporal phenomena and the measurements that we perform are closely tied to those properties. In a constrained experimental setting it can be linked to the temporal features (like duration, interstimulus intervals) of stimulus presentation.

How fast is synaptic processing? At which timescales do neural network dynamics unfold?


The Idea of a Temporal Code
=====
Temporal precision matters. It plays a role in neural coherence, spike-timing-dependent plasticity and 

Why Brain Rhythms alone are not enough
---
Rhythms in the brain, representing synchronous activity of large excitatory pyramidal cells, have for a long time hypothesized to fulfill the role of a pacemaker. At least Gamma. How do they do it?
While Gamma oscillations have primarily been linked to local network computations, oscillations in slower frequency ranges have been linked to mediating long range connections (between distant) brain areas.

Concept of Intrinsic Neural Timescales 
---
Explain why different regions show different timescales.
Early areas show shorter timescales compared to higher order regions (measured via autocorrelation window).
The decay rate of a neural signals autocorrelation function is estimated.
Specifically, the neural signal is correlated with a time-lagged version of itself and scaled by its variance.


How can we measure intrinsic neural timescales and how do they change with task demands?
