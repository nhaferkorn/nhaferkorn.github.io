How can we best understand the timescales of neural systems?
=====
Temporal structure dictactes our daily life. We experience time periods with varying amounts of incoming sensory stimulation (which can be more or less regular / rhythmic in its nature).
Neural processes are spatiotemporal phenomena and the measurements that we perform are closely tied to those as well.
How fast is synaptic processing? How fast are neural network dynamics (reverberation).
In a constrained experimental setting its ultimately tied to the temporal features (like duration, interstimulus intervals) of stimulus presentation.

<!-- The Idea of a Temporal Code
=====
Temporal precision matters. It plays a role in neural coherence, spike-timing-dependent plasticity and  -->

Why Brain Rhythms alone are not enough
======
Rhythms in the brain, representing synchronous activity of large excitatory pyramidal cells, have for a long time hypothesized to fulfill a pacemaker role. At least Gamma. How do they do it?
While Gamma oscillations have primarily linked to local network computations (fast rhythm), oscillations in slower frequency ranges have been linked to mediating long range connections (between distant) brain areas.

Concept of Intrinsic Neural Timescales (INT)
======
Explain why different regions show different timescales.
Early areas show shorter timescales compared to higher order regions (measured via Autocorrelation Window).
Characterized by the decay rate of a neural signals autocorrelation function.
Specifically, the neural signal is correlated with a time-lagged version of itself and scales by its variance.


How can we measure intrinsic neural timescales and how do they change with task demands?
<!-- ======
What is the functional role of intrinsic neural time scales?
Serves temporal integration and segregation of input.
How can we relate them back to functionally relevant behavioral output? -->
