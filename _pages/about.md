I'm currently studying Cognitive Neuroscience at Radboud University in Nijmegen. 

I'm excited to work with different types of neural data (fMRI, M/EEG, etc.) to better understand brain dynamics at various spatiotemporal scales. 
I canâ€™t help but always dive deep into the methods sections of papers and discover new analysis approaches.
I value interdisciplinary projects and try to combine my interests in brain imaging, Neuro-AI with the methods training from my Psychology background.

I am very passionate about meta-scientific issues. These include supporting the open science movement, learning more about the philosophy of science, and making sustainable choices in my daily (research) life.

Outside of science, I love hiking and spending time in nature.
I am also a big theatre nerd and love watching and reading plays.
